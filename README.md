The Falling is a game created in 24 hours for a game jam by [Joshua Fox (Artist)](https://joshuafox.pb.design/) and [Ben Wilson (Programmer)](https://ben-w.com/).
The aim of the game is to remember which hole has the flag in at the start, then jump over the holes with lava to reach the correct hole. You can also collect coins to increase your score but you risk running out of time.

The theme of this game jam was "5 Seconds to Live" and was hosted at our college as an end of year game jam. The game jam was spread over 4 days of 6 hours each.

You can play the game on [itch.io](https://hiddendetail.itch.io/the-falling).
